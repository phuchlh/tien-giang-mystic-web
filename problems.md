# Handling Post-Login States and Session Management

## 1. Preserving Chat Results After Login

### Problem

When a user interacts with the chat feature before logging in and receives tour recommendations, these results need to be preserved through the login process. This is necessary because:

-   The web application rebuilds after login
-   Without preservation, the valuable chat results would be lost
-   Users would need to repeat their chat interaction

### Proposed Solution

1. **Temporary State Storage**

    - Implement temporary storage using Flutter Web's shared_preferences package
    - Store the chat results before initiating the login process
    - Include relevant metadata like timestamp and query context

2. **State Recovery**
    - After login completes, check for stored chat results
    - Restore the chat interface with preserved results
    - Clear the temporary storage after successful restoration

### Implementation Details

1. **Storage Mechanism**

    - Use shared_preferences for non-logged-in users only
    - Store data structure:
        ```
        {
          "temporary_tours": {
            "timestamp": DateTime,
            "tours": List<Tour>,
            "chatContext": Map<String, dynamic>
          }
        }
        ```

2. **Data Flow**

    - Not Logged In:
        - Chat Input → AI Response → Store in shared_preferences → Display Results
    - During Login:
        - Login Process → Fetch from shared_preferences → Restore to State → Clear Storage

3. **State Management**

    - Use app's state management (Provider/Bloc/Riverpod) for logged-in users
    - Only utilize shared_preferences as temporary storage
    - Clear shared_preferences after successful login and state restoration

4. **Key Considerations**
    - Handle web storage limitations
    - Implement proper data serialization
    - Manage cleanup after login
    - Handle storage operation errors
    - Validate state restoration
    - Show appropriate loading indicators
    - Handle edge cases (storage errors, failed login, network issues)

## 2. Session Tracking for Liked Tours

### Problem

Users need the ability to track and revisit their liked tours across sessions, which requires:

-   Persistent storage of user preferences
-   Association between users and their liked tours
-   Session management for authentication

### Proposed Solution

1. **Session Management**

    - Store sessionID and authentication token after successful login
    - Post these credentials to Supabase for persistent storage
    - Use these credentials to maintain user state

2. **Like Feature Implementation**

    - Each tour result will include a "like" button
    - Liked tours will be associated with the user's account
    - Users can access their liked tours through their profile

3. **Data Structure**
    - Store user session data including:
        - SessionID
        - Authentication token
        - User ID
        - Timestamp
    - Link liked tours to user profiles for future reference

## Implementation Considerations

-   Ensure secure storage of temporary data
-   Handle edge cases (e.g., login failures, network issues)
-   Implement proper cleanup of temporary storage
-   Consider rate limiting and storage quotas
-   Maintain user privacy and data protection
